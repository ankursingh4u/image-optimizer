/**
 * The product catalog the Product Image Optimization page renders.
 *
 * A resource route (no default export) so the page can ask for it AFTER it has
 * painted. Building this list takes seconds — one Shopify request per 50
 * products, sequential because pagination is cursor-based, each carrying up to
 * 250 media nodes — and while it lived in the page loader, React Router could
 * not complete the navigation until it finished, so opening the optimizer
 * looked dead. Now the page renders instantly and fills in when this returns.
 *
 * Keeping it out of the page loader also makes refreshing after a run cheap:
 * the page re-requests this one endpoint instead of revalidating everything.

  // fetcher.load(), which goes through React Router's single-fetch endpoint and
  // serializes the returned value itself.
  //
  // buildCatalog never rejects — a failure comes back as { error } so the page
  // can show a banner instead of an error boundary.
